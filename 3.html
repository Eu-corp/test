<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language developed by Netscape was first used in Netscape browsers. However, Netscape was working with European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) to deliver a standardized, international programming language based on core JavaScript. ECMA is an international standards association for information and communication systems. This standardized version of JavaScript, called ECMAScript, behaves the same way in all applications that support the standard. Companies can use the open standard language to develop their implementation of JavaScript. The first version of the ECMA standard was documented in the ECMA-262 specification. The ECMA-262 standard is also approved by the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) as ISO-16262.

<p style="margin-top:45px;">하루는 웹 개발을 하다가 흔히 사용하는 개념인 JavaScript와 ECMAScript가 정확히 무슨 차이가 있는지 궁금해졌습니다. 그래서 구글링을 해보았지만, 이는 오히려 제 혼란을 가중시켰습니다. 검색해 나온 답변들은 너무 모호했고, 심지어 상반된 의견들도 있었습니다.
